# Food Delivery Service Website - FREAKY FOOD

This project aims to create a **food delivery service website** that allows users to explore area restaurants, view menus, place orders, write reviews, and save their favorite spots. The website will cater to various user roles, including customers, vendors, and drivers, with distinct interfaces for each.

## Project Overview

The website will start with **static mock data** and may later expand to use the **Google Maps API** for location-based features. The core functionalities include:

- **Restaurant Listings**: Users can browse a list of area restaurants.
- **Menu Viewing**: Users can view menus for each restaurant.
- **Order Creation**: Users can create and place orders.
- **Reviews**: Users can write reviews for restaurants.
- **Favorites**: Users can save favorite restaurants for easy access.

## User Interfaces

The website will feature different user interfaces based on the type of user:

- **Customer Interface**: Allows customers to browse restaurants, view menus, place orders, write reviews, and save favorites.
- **Vendor Interface**: Enables restaurant vendors to manage their listings, update menus, and track orders.
- **Driver Interface**: Provides drivers with tools to manage deliveries, view pending orders, and navigate to destinations.

## Key Features

- **Authentication**: Account creation and login functionality will be implemented, requiring users to authenticate through a database.
- **Order Management**: Standard order tracking features will be available, but there is no need for email confirmations or detailed order history.
- **Dynamic Data**: The project will start with static mock data and may expand to include dynamic data through the Google Maps API.
- **Optional Features**:
  - **Email Notifications**: Potentially notify users about order updates (to be confirmed).
  - **Point System**: Implement a reward system for users (to be confirmed).
  - **Alcohol Purchase Quiz**: A quiz for age verification when purchasing alcohol (to be confirmed).

## Development Notes

- **Restaurant Validation**: No need for a validation process for restaurant listings at this time.
- **Differentiation**: The project will initially clone existing functionalities of similar services, with differentiation left to creative development.
- **Feedback and Advice**: Regular consultations with project stakeholders, including Seamus, will guide feature implementations and project direction.
